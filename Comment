I really like the organization of the webpage. I really learn a lot by there design. I think I can incorporate these into my project.
In addition, the color and fond they chose is really comfortable and harmony. 

The code itself is clean and neat. I can see they use HTTP call to fetch data from API and use JSON to parse the data.
It is very smart to have such a convinient set up with GOOGLE API and I learn a lot from these techniques.
